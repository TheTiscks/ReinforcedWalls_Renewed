# Renewed version of 'Reinforced Walls'
##### Rimworld mod
![Previewpic](https://github.com/TheTiscks/ReinforcedWalls_Renewed/blob/main/About/Preview.png)
Compatible with Rimworld 1.5+

This mod works better than original mod by Neceros with newer versions of the game: wall mounted lamps added in the 1.5 update can be placed on the walls (as well as wall attachable objects added by other mods)

*Unlike some other 'Reinforced walls' versions, Renewed doesn`t require any other mods to work properly*

------
Adds expensive heavy reinforced walls with exceptional hit points that resists explosive damage.

Additionally, you get an embrasure version of the heavy reinforced wall (you can shoot through it, but not walk through it) providing 65% cover from fire.

Works with all stone and metal materials (even modded)

Research one industrial project to gain access. Add to a save just fine. Remove it from a save easy too, just remove the walls first.
